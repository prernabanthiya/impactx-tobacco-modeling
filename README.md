# 🚀 Tobacco Consumption Analysis - ImpactX Hackathon 2025

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze tobacco consumption trends across different states in India, leveraging **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning models** to derive key insights. The findings contribute to social impact by identifying high-risk regions and recommending policy interventions.

📂 Dataset Used - [National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/national-family-health-survey-nfhs-2019-21)

The dataset consists of demographic and tobacco consumption-related variables collected from different regions.
Total Rows: 706
Total Columns: 94

## 📊 Key Findings  
- **Higher women's education levels (10+ years)** correlate with lower male tobacco use.  
- Certain states, like **Mizoram and Tripura**, have significantly higher tobacco consumption rates.  
- The **Random Forest and XGBoost models** provided valuable insights into the influencing factors.  

## 🎯 Real-World Impact  
- **Targeted interventions** in high-risk states.  
- **Policy recommendations**:  
  - Promote **women's education & empowerment** programs.  
  - Implement **stricter tobacco control policies**.  
  - Collaborate with **NGOs** to support tobacco cessation.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Languages**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling**: Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Documentation & Reporting**: Jupyter Notebook, PDF Report  

## 📌 Future Work
Improve model accuracy with feature engineering.

Perform time-series analysis to forecast trends.

Build an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring.
